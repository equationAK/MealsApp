# MealsApp

This is an app that I made for a University Project. I did all the code for backend.
A friend helped me by creating the FrontEnd.

MealsApp is an application collesting data from https://www.themealdb.com/api.php by user input search criteria.
User can save the meals form the search results to a meal list of favotites meals (DB) where the meals can be edited
or deleted if the user wants so. The app also keeps record of the times that the user preview a meal from the favorites
 list and exports a list of the top 10 favorites. The list can also be exproted to pdf file. Version two will have more
features.
